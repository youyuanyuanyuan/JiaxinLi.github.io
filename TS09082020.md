Here is a mindmap representing my core area of interest (virtual cemetries) and its subset topics. 



# Initial Literature Review 

This is the first week of Thesis studio. Before first online class begin, I rethink what happened in my life recently and tried to find out some good ideas for Thesis Studio to explore. 

After brainstorm and organize, I got three ideas:

### 1/3

  An online service of everything about sencond-hand car which designed especially for women. 
     I found the first question as a feminist. One day when I want to buy a second-hand car and viewed several websites, I found it almost an impossible task for me to make a decision for several reasons (pain point for users as well):
     
-   afraid of being dumped 
-   afraid of buying a car with hidden fault, need to fix them very often
-   lots of information about insurance, auto repair， car care and so on…  that’s could be overwhelming for somebody new to the field
-  Lots of car brands， public opinions are divergent， no unified and directive one.  might be confusing.
- For someone don’t know car at all, there’s no any websites or other info source stands in their point of view and to answer some possible questions. Like “what protection could this particular type of car give you when you are being hit by another car”
- All websites I have viewed use terminologies, like hatchback, lift-back and so on. these words are rarely being used in daily lives and hard to remember. That’s actually set a high threshold for users.
So, the practical problem of the first one could be: 
•	Condition: There is no second-hand car exchange website for women who are new to this field
•	Cost: Women new to second-hand car field hard to find car that they are satisfied


The research problem will be:
I am studying how to design a second- hand car trade website especially for women who don’t familiar with this market. Because I want to find how to help this type of people to get cars that they are satisfied without being teased or overwhelmed. In order to help everyone could buy cars in a fair condition. And that might be helpful to eliminate the inequality between people.


### 2/3

2. A virtual cemetery, that could help people could not memorial their dead loved ones because of multiple reasons (for example, long distance or time conflict and so on...)to relieve their lovesickness.

As an international student, every time when Qingming festival comes (a festival for people to offer libation for dead relatives), I cannot visit the graves and sweep the tomb for my grandma because of distance, which made me feel sad. So, I am thinking, today digital life already a part of us, why don’t we introduce death into digital world as well? 

I am thinking of making a digital Cemetery, where people could sweep tomb, leave message and so on. 

The practical problem for the second idea would be:

•	Condition: many people miss their dead family members or friends but cannot memorial them because of distance

•	Cost: people cannot feel the warm brings by visiting loved one’s tomb, and solve the lovesickness 

The research problem would be:
I am studying how to build a digital cemetery. Because I want to find could a digital solemn cemetery be an alternative way of a real one. In order to help people, relieve their lovesickness and bring them power. What’s more is I want to see that could this be a new lifestyle for people in the future.

#### Prototype

Because what I intend to do with this one is a website with/or an mobile app. So I interviewed some friends and made two persona which represent my target audience.

### 3/3

3. A moonscreen for Vampires. Because moonlight is comes from sunlight, so I think moonlights should be harmful for vampires to some extent, they just not as lethal as sunlights for vampires. So I am thinking of doing this moonscreen product for Vampires. However, I know it's not a good topic for Thesis. I will save this one for future.
