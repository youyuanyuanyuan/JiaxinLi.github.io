<h4>my question: How to alleviate people's fear towards death?</h4>
<p>
    There was an artist made an installation called “Zen”. It is something that try to imitate <br>the experience after death. I think it’s rather an experience than an installation. <br>People stick together, going forward in a heavy fog, don’t know where they are, <br>don’t know where they go, the only thing they know is “keep going”. However,<br> different with “zen”, I want to focus more on “the process of death” instead of “things <br>after death”. I want to make an installation set, but I don’t have ideas about the <br>form.
