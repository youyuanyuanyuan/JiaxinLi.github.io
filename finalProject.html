<h1> Midterm</h1>
<h2>10/01/19 - Research Observation</h2>
<p>The two questions I kept are:</p>
<h4>1. How to alleviate people's fear towards death?</h4>
<h4>2. How to enhance people’s level of self reflection?</h4>
<p>During the online comment section, I received a lot of valuable feedback from my classmates. I looked up the links of articles and have been reading them and viewed all the videos as well.</p>

<p>After a hard deciding process, I chose the first question: <b>" How to alleviate people's fear towards death? "</b> to be my final question.</p>
<P> I really want to talk about death. I think death is mysterious, everyone as long as they are alive cannot say what is death. I feel strong interest in exploring this area</P>
<P> From my observation and life experience, people (at least people around me) are not comfortable by talking about death, especially older people. Everytime when I speak the word "death" in frint<br>
of my parents, I will be fiercely criticized. I don't know why they overeact with death, to me death is just a status and everyone will get it in the end. However, lots people are afraid of death severely
that even form a constume. I wonder why and I wonder is there anyway I can help to alleviate their fearness towards death.<br> </P>

<p>For the observation part, I decided to interview people about their opinions regarding to death. Some of the result I get it from hospice institution discussion board(who are hospice patients, <br>from people who have cared for hospice patients or family members in hospice or from hospice workers who have made caring for the gravely ill and the dying their jobs), some of them I get from people in an older <br>age (50 and older), and the rest of them from classmates in my age (in their early 20s).</p>

<p>Here I recorded all the answers and questions:</p>

<p>Interview:</p>
<p>

-Do you fear about death?<br>
1. never thought about that before. maybe not<br>
2.yes<br>
3.no, I am a man<br>
4.kinds of ..<br>
5.no<br>
6.⁠No. but I fear of what happens to the people I love when I’m gone. I also get afraid of missing the people I will leave behind.<br>
7.No, but pain I fear a great deal.<br>
<br>
- What do you think can alleviate your fear about death if you do?/ why you not fear about that?<br>
1.I had a near death experience. I was brought back and my life was forever changed. Since then, without question I know there is <br>life after death and do not fear the transition from temporal life to eternal life.<br>
2.if I die with all my loved ones settled down and being happy, I will not fear of it anymore.<br>
3.I don’t afraid of anything. That’s my request for myself<br>
4.I just so afraid of being left alone… might be better if someone go with me? but that not gonna happen hahaha.<br>
5.I have seen a lot of dying.<br>
6.when my mom was dying she said it was very peaceful. I believe in the afterlife and in the salvation of Jesus. And I’ve experienced too many things to suggest that there isn’t “life” beyond our physical world. <br>So in that regard, I’m unafraid. But I do fear of that I won’t want to leave my husband and that sadness plus a dying body would become extremely difficult for myself and my husband to deal with. <br>I’m not entirely sure what would make that easier.<br>
7.In my 20's I worked in Somali refugee camps. Those experiences pushed me to confront my feelings regarding death and dying. I don't fear death because, as a Christian, I believe dying in this world means being<br> in the presence of God in the next. What if your wrong? I've been asked. So what, if death is just the end then I should focus on being the best I can in the here and now shouldn't I?<br>
<br>
- Do you think “understand more about facts of death” will be helpful to face death?<br>
1.absolutely. <br>
2.yes. but I think that’s hard.<br>
3.it might be.<br>
4.yep.<br>
5.I don't know.<br>
6.⁠yeah, I do. At least I think that’s part of the equation. I think the more facts you have (about anything) <br>the better informed you are and that leads to better understanding and less fear.<br>
7.As a hospice chaplain speaking with people about what we know about dying has contributed to calming the fears of many patients.<br>
<br>
- Do you think you understand the process of death?<br>
1.no.. I am too young to think of it.<br>
2.if you main physically, yes. But mentally, no.<br>
3.no. I don’t think that need to be understand.<br>
4.I know it a little bit, but I am not a professions.<br>
5.Yes because I’m a hospice nurse and I’ve seen dying.<br>
6.yes<br>
7.Yes.<br>
