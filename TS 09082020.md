* Which questions remain?

This is the first week of Thesis studio. Before first online class begin, I rethink what happened in my life recently and tried to find out some good ideas for Thesis Studio to explore. 

After brainstorm and organize, I got three ideas:

1. An online service of everything about sencond-hand car which designed especially for women. ï¼ˆbecause once I want to buy a second hand car, but I found almost all webpages I have browsed use terminologies that I am not familiar of, and 

2. A virtual cemetery, that could help people could not memorial their dead loved ones because of multiple reasons (for example, long distance or time conflict and so on...)to relieve their lovesickness.

3. A moonscreen for Vampires. Because moonlight is comes from sunlight, so I think moonlights should be harmful for vampires to some extent, they just not as lethal as sunlights for vampires. So I am thinking of doing this moonscreen product for Vampires. However, I know it's not a good topic for Thesis. I will save this one for future.
