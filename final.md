#Final project 
---

I am someone who can always generate random ideas in anytime. There was one time, when I taking class, I begin to think about a friend of mine. He is a medical student,he sheared me a lot of stories about what he has experienced in hospitals. Those stories are always about death and fear, it's easy to understand as everyone alive don't know what exactly is death,and unknown brings fearness. He told me, whatever how strong or how smart, how decent a person was, he or she will lose their mind and willing to sacrifice everything in order to get longer life, none of them want to face death,especailly people who taking more power and money in their younger age. 

By think of that, I suddenly realize how people fear about death. The fearness might be varied because of different personalities, different culture, different religions and so on. However, people think they are not fear of death in their younger age can not escape from that fearness when they really really close to death. 

Maybe, as a designer, I could do something about that? **What can I do to alleviate people's fearness towards death?** I started my journey from here...


Observation
---
In order to find out what people's imgination about death in deep. I decided to take interviews with a set of well-designed questions.For making interviewees more focused about my questions and scenes I have setted and getting a better result, I took form that's similar to meditation somehow.

The first Interviewee is peer of mine, 24 years old, Electronic Engineering graduate student. Before taking this interview, I treated him a cup of herbel tea to help him calm down and getting a more ready condition for my interview observation. After a simple greeting, I asked him to sit in any relaxing pose he want, and begin my interview:

I asked my first question in a gentle voice:  Close your eyes, clean your mind, deep breath: breath in ….. breath out….(slow and light voice). Now please imagine there is one day, when sunset finally comes, orange sun light spray all over your surrounding... you have almost experienced everything in your life, you close your book, put down your reading glasses. You know you are going to welcome the end of your life, what do I hope about my death? you think to yourself... please take your time, and please speak out to depict the scene that you think will happen when you die….. 

He took that seriously as well, he contemplate for a while with his eyes closed and then answerd: I never thought of this question before, let me think....I hope, when I die, I could die peacefully. Just fall in sleep the night before that and never get up again....I don't want to disturb my relatives, don't want my death brings them any panic...Also, I want to die because of aging, not because of illness, so I don't feel so painful and don't let the last period of my life being indecent, with a suffering look...

I kept dig in to his answer: well, so you don't want to disturb anybody... so do you want them to know your death?

He answerd: Oh yes.. of course.. I hope all my loved ones can come together and look me after my death, If my children work in another city I hope them to come back and remember my leave..Them I will be felt being loved and worth the trip in this world.

I followed up with my second question: after your death, what are words that you want to engrave in your tombstone? Oh, you can open your eyes now.

He looked at me and smiled: Wow, you really got good questions! emmm... I need sometime to think about it... I think family members are the most important thing to me in the world, and I want to mention them in my tombstone... well.. I would like to go with that "Don't be too sad, I am just go to enjoy my family times earlier than you".

I said: I like that one, that's a good one isn't it? It's sounds like joking but contains a deep, soft thinking of yours.
Well. Thank you for your cooperations, can you use a few strokes and colors to depict the experience of doing this exercise? or           you can find a pic in the internet which could represent your thought and feeling better. Just using notes in your phone to draw that.

He don't know that note can do drawings and I teached him a little bit, then I got this:

I asked: Can you please explain this for me?

He said: Well, in the middle is a chinese charater "人" (a person), not only represent myself but represent all of us. The balck represent death, that's common right? black just like the status of death, nothing, can hear anything or see anything. However, the black is being arounded with warmer and warmer color,so everything is not too bad, the balck will be turn to warm at the end. 

He kept a warm smile while saying this... I was being touched somehow ...

He is a friend of mine and I know he is a good person. But before this interview, I never found that he is such a kind, positive person. While doing this interview, he always consider about others feeling, don't want to screw up other's life because of his death...I believe I know him better after this interview observation and I do think this interview could be a tool to minimize the gap between people now.
