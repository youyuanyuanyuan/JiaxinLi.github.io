#Final project 
---

I am someone who can always generate random ideas in anytime. There was one time, when I taking class, I begin to think about a friend of mine. He is a medical student,he sheared me a lot of stories about what he has experienced in hospitals. Those stories are always about death and fear, it's easy to understand as everyone alive don't know what exactly is death,and unknown brings fearness. He told me, whatever how strong or how smart, how decent a person was, he or she will lose their mind and willing to sacrifice everything in order to get longer life, none of them want to face death,especailly people who taking more power and money in their younger age. 

By think of that, I suddenly realize how people fear about death. The fearness might be varied because of different personalities, different culture, different religions and so on. However, people think they are not fear of death in their younger age can not escape from that fearness when they really really close to death. 

Maybe, as a designer, I could do something about that? **What can I do to alleviate people's dearness towards death?** I started my journey from here...
