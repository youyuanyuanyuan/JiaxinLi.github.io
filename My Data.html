    <h3>Me, My Data</h3>
        <br>
    <p>I believe life is sometimes just like water, it keeps growing...growing... <br>
       until we meet our end, the sea, where all of growned people getting together<br>
       happily, hopefully, waiting to welcome new people to our final heaven. </p>
       <br>
    <p>In "Me, my data" project. I spend more time to think deeper about all the open-ended <br>
       possibilities of death, and made more observations and interviews. When I done my phase 2 <br>
       interview, I just feel a strong desire to explore more about forms to show my findings and <br>
       thinkings. So here the project borned.  </p>
       <br>
    <p>Here is my first product for this project, in a postcard size. I like the postcard size, it's <br>
       delicate, enough space to deliver things and don't leave too much embarassing blanks. </p>
<br>

    <p>There is one question during my interview session that is "What do you really fear about <br>
        when you say you fear about death?" I only ask this question to people who admit they are<br>
        having kind of fearness towards death. 
    </p>
<br>
    <p>People's answers are actually long and pointless, I can tell the most of them never thought <br>
        about this question before, so this question took time for them to think about while interview.<br>
        I processed every sentence people said, and get a few keywords from their answers, and put them <br>
        in the postcard from the lightest to the heaviest fearness.
    </p>
<br>
    <P>Here comes my second product for project "Me, My data". This one is in a poster size </P>
    <br>
    <image src="poster.jpg" width=50%></image>
    <br>
    <p>In this poster, I tried to combine what I have findouts to a strong style in order to achieve <br>
        an overall harmony in both logical and visual aspects. 
        </p>
        <br>
    <p>The first part in this product is about color collection. In the interview session, after all the<br>
    questions about death, I asked all the interviewee to draw an abstract painting to depict their thought<br>
    and feelings when doing that interview exercise. In color collection, I picked every color appeared in <br>
    their painting. What amazed me is, quite different from what I soppose, the overall color collection is <br>
    quite colorful, most of them are light colors. I thought it can reflect people's positive attitude towards<br>
    death to some extent</p>
    <br>
    <p>The second part in this product is an visual recording of my observation regarding to death. I chose <br>
        an interviewee, and observed her for a whole day to record every time slot and content when she speak <br>
        anything about death. Here I made a visual infographic according to this observation. I using straight <br>
        and short lines to represent "1" , using short curly lines to represent "2", and the strong waving lines <br>
        to represent "3".So it could show the relationship of how many death reference in her daily talk to her <br>
        time slots</p>

        <br>
    <p>I do feel thrilled to do this project, and I feel confused about that in the beginning. However, now I <br>
    think it might because I have discovered a really creative way of doing data visualization. I am quite <br>satisfied
     with this project, I thought it gives me more chance of exploring the design world.</p>
