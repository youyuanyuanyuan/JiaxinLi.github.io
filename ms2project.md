Ideation Phase:

# Pain point: 
According to my observation and persional experience, certain group of people (include me) really sensitive to how others view us. At this cirsumstance, confidence improvement becomes really important to us. 
In different occasions, especially some important ones (like dating, business meetings,etc), if I dress wrong or different with others, I will feel so uncomfortable and could never fit in to people anymore.
So I want to make a project to help people who are as low confident as me to dress correctly in order to improve confidence and social performance.

# Target audience:
People who are not confident of taking outfit and don't want to make mistake to lower their confidence.

# Goal:
Help user dress properly thus boost their social performance and confidence.

# Project overview:
