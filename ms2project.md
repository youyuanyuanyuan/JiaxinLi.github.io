Ideation Phase:

# Pain point: 
According to my observation and persional experience, certain group of people (include me) really sensitive to how others view us. At this cirsumstance, confidence improvement becomes really important to us. 
In different occasions, especially some important ones (like dating, business meetings,etc), if I dress wrong or different with others, I will feel so uncomfortable and could never fit in to people anymore.
So I want to make a project to help people who are as low confident as me to dress correctly in order to improve confidence and social performance.

# Target audience:
People who are not confident of taking outfit and don't want to make mistake to lower their confidence.

# Goal:
Help user dress properly thus boost their social performance and confidence.

# Project overview:
"properfect"

# personal outfit journal (experience with different outfit everyday):

## DAY 1

![First outfit](IMG_0440.jpg)

This outfit is one of my favourite. I choose this especially for our Tokyo Universal world trip. 

It was during summer vocation with a big sun, so I want to look energetic and cool.In orfer to show vitality, I chose a bright yellow as the main color of this outfit. For physical sunscreening, I was wearing a hat with a huge brim. The color of my hat is kind of matchy with my skirt.

I thought I have made a great choice and I had a wonderful experience at that day. 

## DAY 2


![Second outfit](IMG_8953.jpg)

This outfit was shot by my classmate. It was a game design class, I was get up late and just randomly picked something to wear.In the left side was another classmate of mine. The photo taker said to us "both of you not looking like come here to have class. You looks like gender avatar options provided in the beginning of a game!". 

It was an unique experience undeniably, but I was feeling like I was wearing wrong outfit for that occasion (at this time, college class). After this issue, I cannot stop myself doubting about my choice and cannot focus on the class.
