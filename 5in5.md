In order to generate more possible ideas and find out what I really care and want to pursue, I am going to commit a 5-in-5 exercise. Basically, this is to force myself to generate a new idea related to the topic and invove that into a prototype with whatever material for everyday. In the second day, start this from a brand new idea again and totally forget about what have done the last day.

As my topic is blushing, I want to keep going to two directions specifically that relates to the topic but a little away from three point: 1. social anxiety, 2. aesthetics and 3. Bio-feedback


###The first day: 

#Artificial Blusher

For the first day, I did some preparation. I read an academic articles and which calimed that " people who blushing will be accepted by groups more easily. " I also saw another research result "people all blushing, but the visibility of their blushing varies depending on individuals." After brainstorm, I want to make something that could connect these two results together. 

So the problem right now need to be solved by my design is " How can I design to help people reduce or even eliminate the "unfairness" about blushing. I decide to make an "artificial blusher":

Although the visibility of everyone's blushing is different depends on that person's skin color, body condition and so on. However, everyone when blushing have higher skin temperature. So I decide to use this point as something keep digging into.
  
I make this little thing which could feel the increase of the raise of your skin temperature and start to light up the inner led whick makes everyone else knows that you are blushing. Also, there you can choose different colors and flashing pattern for your artificial blusher in order to represent your personality better. Artificial blusher could bring more topics and interactions for you when you in a social scene.

The theme of augmentation relates to my work because I incresed the level of visibility of people's blushing.

It felt easy to express your social embarrassment in a funnier and easier way in order to relax you and brings you a better social conditions.

I was really challenged by generating this idea.

If I could have changed one thing about this process I would explore more about how to make a real stuff instead of a prototype.


###The Second day: 

#Blushing and Aesthetics

The question which drives me towards working on this prototype is "What's the relationship between blushing and cultures?"

Today I want to explore the relationship between blushing, culture, represententation and aesthetics. I am wondering what is the role that blushing play in their local area. If anyone blushing, will a group of people came from different culture feels the same thing? 

In order to explore that, I have read lots journals about their cultural attitude towards to blushing, and if they make up, which part will they blush? What kind of cultural information and aesthetics does that deliver? According to that, I made a video to display the different kinds of methods of using blusher as a makeup product in different culture areas.

The theme of augmentation relates to my work because I explored not only my local culture's attitudes but also lots other cultures'.

###The Third day: 

#Tree Hole

The question today is " what can I design to make people getting rid of social anxiety through sharing?"

Today I want to focus on social anxiety and make design for that. For preparation, I read through about who we getting social anxiety and what are ways to get rid of it. The first and biggest method for doing that is to share your experience within an environment which you think you are completely safe to being with. 

Thus I decide to make an online sharing website for people to share their embarassing experience, little secrets, evil thoughts and so on. People can stay anonymous in this web.
