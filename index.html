<h4>Phase 1</h4>
<h5>Location chosen: Common area of 90 columbus (New Jersey)</h5>
<P> I chosen this place because it is a reletaively a more "secret space". In first week, I only focused on finding a "public space" but forget to think about more details for future implementations.
    <br> By chosing this place, I was quite pride that our group is the only one who didn't chose a totally public place. But I seem so wrong by looking back now.
    <br> the restriction accessibility of people in this area represents less interaction possibility between people and our instruction sets.
</P>

<p>problem: too less interaction, our targeted user--childrens cannot get out at weekdays's eve.

<p>Research</p>
<p>During the research, we found that many people look down to their phones when sitting on the bench</p>

<image src="r2.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>

<image src="r6.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>but here I got one exception</p>

<p> beautiful view being ignored</p>
<p>This is the view at eye level when people sit on the bench</p>
<image src="lookdown.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>If they look up, they’d see a more beautiful view of nature. But almost nobody looks and enjoy the beauty of nature</p>
<image src="lookup.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<br>
<p>Why not make people look up to the sky?</p>
<br>
<P>Intentions</P>
<br>
<p>We are going to make something that augments interaction between people and the surrounding environment, people and nature.<br>
    Make people rethink the relationship between city and the nature<br>
    Target reaction and feelings: Emotional and playful<br>
    </p>
<br>
<p>On-site Prototype</p>
<p>We did some adjustment.<br>

    The wind was strong so we have to shorten the wire and put the box aside the path in case the balloon were blown slanting getting in the way of visitors.

<p>Interview after Interaction 1</p>
<image src="inter1.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>“ I pretty like it. It makes the park looks more gregeous.”<br>

    “It’s kinds of low, I have to squatted down for shotting pics”<br>
    He also made some suggestion after we illustrated our idea to him<br>
    “My suggestion is to make balloons in a bigger size, with more helim, so they will be much lighter than now.”<br>
    
    </p>
    <image src="inter2.jpg"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
    <p>“My son loves it! Thank you so much. You made his day!”<br>

        “Those fallen leaves are great idea. If there is only a bunch of balloons, it might be too ordinary”<br>
        
        “It might be troublesome.. Those fishing wires are invisible but firm. They might be suffocated themselves by using that”<br>
        
        </p>

<br>
<p>Summary</p>
<p> Great amount of interaction between people and people as well as people and environment.<br>
    Interaction time is longer than we thought<br>
    Get lots useful feedback<br>
    
    For the next step<br>
    reconsider the form of the box and find a better way to represent the city<br>
    reconsider the form of the object flying above<br>
    reconsider the connection between the box and flying object<br>
    higher the balloons
