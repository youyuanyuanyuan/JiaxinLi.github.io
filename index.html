<h4>Prototype 1</h4>
<h5>Location chosen: Common area of 90 columbus (New Jersey)</h5>
<P> I chosen this place because it is a reletaively a more "secret space". In first week, I only focused on finding a "public space" but forget to think about more details for future implementations.
    <br> By chosing this place, I was quite pride that our group is the only one who didn't chose a totally public place. But I seem so wrong by looking back now.
    <br> the restriction accessibility of people in this area represents less interaction possibility between people and our instruction sets.
</P>

<p>problem: too little interaction, our targeted user--childrens cannot get out at weekdays's evening.</p>

<b>so we decide to change our location to a "more public" space, after investigations, we decided Medison Square Park as our final location</b>


<h4>Prototype 2</h4>

<p>Location:Madison Square Park</p>

<p>Research</p>
<p>During the research, we found that many people look down to their phones when sitting on the bench</p>

<image src="r2.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>

<image src="r6.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>but here I got one exception</p>

<p> beautiful view being ignored</p>
<p>This is the view at eye level when people sit on the bench</p>
<image src="lookdown.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>If they look up, they’d see a more beautiful view of nature. But almost nobody looks and enjoy the beauty of nature</p>
<image src="lookup.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<br>
<p>"Can we make something to let people look up?" that's the thought that comes into my mind.</p>
<br>
<P>Our intention</P>
<br>
<p>We are going to make something that augments interaction between people and the surrounding environment, people and nature.<br>
    Make people rethink the relationship between city and the nature<br>
    Target reaction and feelings: Emotional and playful<br>
    </p>
<br>

<p>We completely discarded the previous prototype, did a brand new one, that both of us satisfied with. Actually we fight a lot in the location choosing, and about prototype ideas.That's a tiring process<br>but it is great that we finally get to a middle point.<br>
    we made a group of ballons using helim, attched to something represents city (I thought of Lego but we finally decide to use box because of the price),using some leavs hang in the middle to remind people to use them as handle to interact with this installation set (for example, pull the ballon down).<br> 
    <P>It my first time to blow ballons by my own, quite scary and interesting experience to me though.<Br> </P>
        <image src="helim1.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> helim1</image>
        <image src="helim2.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> helim2</image>
        <image src="helim3.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> helim3</image>
      
    <p>We made the ballons first, and then the bottom box. the ballons looks great at first, clean and clear in a really "cloudy" shape.</p>
        <image src="goodstatus1.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> goodstatus 1</image>
        <image src="goodstatus2.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> goodstatus 2</image>

    <p>The process of form ballons together to looks like cloud is really a time-consuming thing, and we have to be survillance of perturb ballon to fly away. Actually I fall down several times when using chair as ladder to reach flyaway ballons.</p>

    <image src="workingprocess2.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> workingprocess2</image>

    <p>but as the time goes by, in just about 1 hour, ballons fall down because of less of helim</p>
    <image src="falldown1.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> falldown 1</image>
    <image src="falldown2.JPG"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> falldown 2</image>
    
   <p>When we doing on-site, the wind was strong so we have to shorten the wire and put the box aside the path in case the balloon were blown slanting getting in the way of visitors.</p>

    <image src="p5.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
    <br>

    <p>Although the process is quite painful and seems people didn't get the underlying meaning of our instruction set. We were happy because people like it, at least we brought happiness to them.</p>

<p>Interview after Interaction 1</p>
<image src="inter1.png"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
<p>“ I pretty like it. It makes the park looks more gregeous.”<br>

    “It’s kinds of low, I have to squatted down for shotting pics”<br>
    He also made some suggestion after we illustrated our idea to him<br>
    “My suggestion is to make balloons in a bigger size, with more helim, so they will be much lighter than now.”<br>
    
    </p>
    <image src="inter2.jpg"style="width:800px;height:600px;"> </image>
    <p>“My son loves it! Thank you so much. You made his day!”<br>

        “Those fallen leaves are great idea. If there is only a bunch of balloons, it might be too ordinary”<br>
        
        “It might be troublesome.. Those fishing wires are invisible but firm. They might be suffocated themselves by using that”<br>
        
        </p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p> Great amount of interaction between people and people as well as people and environment.<br>
    Interaction time is longer than we thought<br>
    Get lots useful feedback<br>
    
    For the next step<br>
    reconsider the form of the box and find a better way to represent the city<br>
    reconsider the form of the object flying above<br>
    reconsider the connection between the box and flying object<br>
    higher the balloons 
    
    <h4>Prototype 3</h4>
    <p>This time we still did a big change on our prototype. Because in the critique session, teacher pointed out that people interact with our instruction set only because people want to play with ballon. <br>
    So we spend a lot of time in thinking about our intention and what we can make to let people still have interest to interact with our instruction set simultaneously</p>

    <p>So we made a lot modification including: <br>
       1. higher the ballons: Last time, the lines tangled a kid and that makes me realize that if the ballons is too low, that could be troublesome to pedestrians which is not expected.<br>
       2. fix the ballons: Last time, because of the wind, our ballons fly all around the place and looks messy because of that. This time, we fix it using three fixing points, it will not moves a lot because of the stablity of triangle principle<br>
       3. being more specific about our intention<br>
       4. add more interest and interaction elements</p>

    <p>after that, we decide to clarify our intention to one point:  to make people look up.  Sometimes less is more.</p>

    <p>some of our ideas</p>

    <P>Idea 1:
         using colorful strip and things that not supposed to appear in park to form our interaction set. I quite like this idea as it's not an ordinary idea. It can bring people think of the meaning of that set and also fulfill out intention.<br>
         However, it cannot to be realized because the park security don't let us put anything on the trunk of trees.
    </P>

    <p>idea 2:
        Story-telling ballons: Make each of the ballons become an element of a complete story. People need to find and interact with each other in order to view the complete story. This one is quite good because it helps with both the interaction<br>
        between people and our instruction set and between people themselves.
        However, it cannot to be realized because we didn't achieve an agreement inside of our group.
    </p>

    <p>idea 3:
        Flourescent painting ballons: Using flourescent spray to draw a painting, in the dark night. People have to hold an ultra-violet light to see that. The insteresting thing is people can only read a little part with ultra- violet a time, cannot <br>
        see the full painting at once. That definetely add the interaction aspect of this intruction set. Also, in my mind, I want to include some reflective papaer in the bottom, when people using ultra-violet light and make the painting shows, the <br>
        image will show blurry in the reflective paper. 
        However, it still cannot being realized because I think our flourescent spray seems corrosive: when we use it, all ballons poped up.
    </p>

 <p> at last, because we were running out of time, we have to give up all our ideas and just using color spray to do a painting in our ballons. Here is some pictures of our final prototype</p>

 <P>My self-reflection:On-site is always having some differentiation with imagination, result would be much better if stick in one idea for three weeks.</P>
